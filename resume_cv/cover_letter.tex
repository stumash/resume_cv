\lettersection{About Me}

I'm a recent McGill University graduate and junior engineer with a strong passion for elegant design. I care deeply about code readability, and I always strive to write code such that its intent is expressed as clearly as possible without sacrificing performance.

I've worked with a decent number of programming languages fairly deeply. I've written multiple web apps with Python, Node.js and Java, using frontend tech like React. I've also done machine learning with Tensorflow and built a Go compiler in OCaml. I'm knowledgeable about concurrency, especially in Java.

My area of interest is scalability. I've taken advanced courses in concurrent programming, distributed systems, and cloud computing. Over the next few years I'd like to apply and refine this knowledge by building robust and scalable cloud architectures. This means I'm definitely looking to continue getting my hands dirty with AWS, Docker, Terraform, and the like.

\lettersection{Why `\jobtitle{}' at \companyname{}}

The position at \companyname{} is particularly interesting to me because it'll give me the chance to take ownership and be in control of what I build. But more than that, I'll get to work on exactly what I want to: scalability. To me, the coolest job is solving the problems of how to write code that can manipulate absurd amounts of data and how to build services that are distributed and highly available to potentially millions of clients. And lastly, I'm excited about this position because it's in the healthcare and medicine space. I've always felt that this space was waiting for automation to strike and I want to be a part of it.

\lettersection{In\ Closing}

Thanks for your time. I hope you will give me the opportunity to prove that I will be a great value-added hire at \companyname{}. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about this opportunity.

%\lettersection{About Me}

%I'm deeply passionate about clean and efficient code and have significant experience in many programming languages. I've written an implementation of Onion Routing in Python, a compiler for Go written in OCaml, and personal and school projects in Java and Javascript (fullstack web apps, mostly). I'm a Linux user at home, and love all things Bash.

%I have a decent background in probability and statistics, and even used a Random Forest to improve the performance of a job scheduling system at my last internship at Nuance Communications.  

%I also have a strong interest in scalability and distributed/cloud computing. I have taken extra courses in concurrency, distributed systems, and cloud computing. I have experience using AWS to deploy scalable web applications using Lambda, S3, EC2, and others. 

%I've written various data scrapers over the years and have experience aggregating, cleaning, and storing data for later querying. I know how to get the job done using relational databases such as Postgre, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.

%\lettersection{Why \jobtitle{} at \companyname{}}

%Well, for one thing, I love the idea of Warby Parker as a business. Luxottica was keeping glasses expensive, and Warby Parker used vertical integration and branding to challenge the status quo, bring prices down, and steal market share.

%But, for another, I expect the company culture at WP to be a good fit for me. My most rewarding work experience so far was at an online advertising company called SourceKnowledge. What made my time there so meaningful was the culture of open communication. If I had to speak to anyone in the company to get my work done, there was no red tape in the way. I found this incredibly helpful, and expect a similar situation at WP.

%But on a technical level, I'm excited to work with other engineers that have a passion for clean, readable, and fast code. I'm eager to raise the quality of my work by meeting the high standards of software quality at WP.

%Given my experience, skills, and interests, I think I'm a good fit for the position and can join the technology team at \companyname{} in continuing to deliver excellent customer experience tools.

%Thank you for your time and consideration.
